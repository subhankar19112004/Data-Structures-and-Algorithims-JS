//Common operations - Stack
let stack = [];     // Simply, Use Array as Stack.

stack.push(1);      // Add inside stack
stack.push(2);      
stack.push(3);      
console.log(stack); // [1, 2, 3]

stack.pop();        // A stack is LIFO (Last In, First Out), so the element that goes in last will come out first. In this case, 3 will be removed.
stack.pop();     
console.log(stack); // [1]

stack.push(7);      // [1, 7]

// For Top element
let top = stack[stack.length - 1];
console.log(top);   // 7

// Invalid: stack[3] – violates stack discipline
// It works fine because it's treated as an array, but this is invalid in the context of a stack.
// Always use push, pop, and peek for proper stack usage.
